# Build an Amazon Shopping Assistant Agent

Hey Tyler! This project is to evaluate your approach to building autonomous agents that can navigate real-world websites and help users shop effectively. Take 2-3 days to show us how you'd tackle this challenge.

## Project Overview

Build an agent that helps users shop on Amazon using natural language. The agent should understand requests like:
"Find me a coffee maker under $100 with good reviews that's available for Prime shipping"

## Part 1: Working Agent Prototype

### Core Capabilities

- Accept natural language shopping requests
- Navigate Amazon's interface and filters
- Extract and compare product information
- Make reasonable decisions based on user preferences
- Handle follow-up questions and refinements

Key Questions to Consider (Please ask us for clarification!):

- How will you handle Amazon's interface? Web scraping? Selenium? Other approaches?
- What's your strategy for rate limiting and avoiding detection?
- How will you handle product comparison and filtering?
- What information should the agent extract vs. ignore?

### Technical Requirements

- Build using any agent framework you prefer
- Include basic error handling for common failures
- Document your setup process and key decisions
- Add enough logging to understand agent behavior

### What We're Looking For

- Smart handling of Amazon's interface
- Effective decision-making logic
- Clean, maintainable code
- Thoughtful prompt engineering
- Basic conversation management

Don't worry about:

- Perfect test coverage
- Production deployment
- Complex security

## Part 2: Design Document

Imagine turning this into a production service that thousands of people use for shopping assistance. Write a design doc covering:

### Project Roadmap & Milestones

Break down how you'd develop this into a full product. Include:

- Clear phases (MVP, v1, v2, etc.)
- Estimated timeline for each milestone
- Dependencies between features
- Critical path items
- Technical risks and contingency plans
- Success criteria for each phase

### Resource Planning

- Team composition needed for each phase
- External dependencies
- Infrastructure requirements
- Cost estimates (development and running costs)
- Technical debt considerations

### Agent Architecture

- How would you make the agent more autonomous?
- Approaches for better reasoning and decision-making
- Handling complex shopping scenarios
- Strategies for maintaining context
- Ideas for personalizing recommendations

### Evaluation & Testing

- How do you know if the agent is actually helpful?
- Methods for evaluating decision quality
- Approaches for gathering user feedback
- Ways to detect and debug failures
- Ideas for automated testing

### Key Challenges & Solutions

- Handling Amazon's anti-bot measures
- Scaling issues and solutions
- Dealing with price/inventory changes
- Managing rate limits
- Handling failed searches or ambiguous requests

### Future Improvements

- Additional features and capabilities
- Ideas for better product understanding
- Novel interaction patterns
- Performance optimizations

## What We're Evaluating

### For the Prototype (40%)

- Can it actually help with shopping?
- Quality of decision-making
- Robustness of implementation
- Conversation handling
- Creative solutions to technical challenges

### For the Design Doc (60%)

- Quality of project breakdown and estimates
- Realistic milestone planning
- Understanding of agent architecture
- Practical evaluation approaches
- Resource planning and prioritization
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Clear success criteria for each phase

## Questions & Clarifications

We expect you'll have questions! Please ask about:

- Scope and requirements
- Technical constraints
- Evaluation criteria
- Specific challenges you encounter

We're very interested in your thought process and how you approach building real-world agents.

## Submission

- Share your code via GitHub
- Include your design doc as PDF/Google Doc
- Add a README explaining your approach
- Demo video showing key interactions
- Submit within 7 days (if that works for you)

Feel free to reach out with any questions or clarifications needed before getting started!
