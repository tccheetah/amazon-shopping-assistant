# Amazon Shopping Assistant - Design Doc - Tyler Corliss

## Overview
This doc outlines the approach for the Amazon Shopping Assistant, a truly autonomous agent capable of performing complex shopping research across multiple products. I started with a straightforward v0 implementation and enhanced it in v1 with features beyond Amazon's standard filters. Now v2 introduces deep product research capabilities and agentic behavior.

## Components

```
User -> ConversationManager -> QueryParser -> AmazonNavigator -> BrowserManager -> Amazon.com
                                                          ^                              |
                                                          |                              v
                                                          +------ ProductAnalyzer <- Product Results
                                                                       |
                                                                       v
                                                                 User Response
```


### BrowserManager
Handles all browser automation with Playwright. After experimenting extensively, I've implemented these anti-detection measures:
- Random delays between actions (configurable, but typically 1-3s)
- Character-by-character typing with tiny random pauses
- Mouse movement simulation with randomized patterns
- User agent configuration and session recovery

Playwright has been crucial here, especially for its auto-waiting features which eliminated most timing issues. Its speed advantage over Selenium (50-60% faster in my testing) has been significant for user experience.

### AmazonNavigator
This component handles Amazon navigation, applying filters, and extracting product data. I've implemented multiple fallback mechanisms:
- 3-4 different selectors for every important element
- Robust extraction for titles, prices, and ratings
- Link parsing with proper ASIN handling
- Fallback strategies for when Amazon changes its layouts

### QueryParser
Converts natural language to structured parameters. Now enhanced with:
- Exact rating threshold extraction (4.7 stars vs just 4+ stars)
- Country of origin detection ("made in Italy")
- Material specifications ("leather", "aluminum")
- Excluded terms ("without BPA")
- Advanced price range parsing

### ProductAnalyzer
Ranks products using a weighted scoring system:
- Rating (30%)
- Reviews (20%)
- Price (20%)
- Prime availability (10%)
- Relevance to query (20%)

The log scaling for review counts made a significant difference, preventing products with 10,000+ reviews from always dominating the results.

### ProductResearcher (V2)
This completely new component performs deep product analysis:
- Extracts specifications from product pages with multiple selector patterns
- Analyzes customer reviews for sentiment and key insights
- Generates comprehensive pros/cons based on both specs and review analysis
- Creates synthetic analysis when review data is limited

I fixed the common "No review text found" issue by implementing fallback analysis based on product descriptions when review data is unavailable.

### AgentFramework (V2)
Another new component providing true agentic capabilities:
- Multi-step planning for complex requests
- User preference tracking and personalization
- Research prioritization based on product type and price point
- Comparative logic with deep feature analysis
- Auto-generated refinement suggestions

The agent now maintains user preferences across sessions, factoring in past interactions to improve future recommendations, with stronger weights for purchases than views.

### ConversationManager
Controls conversation flow and context management:
- Tracks context across multiple turns
- Detects follow-up questions with high accuracy
- Handles refinements and implicit questions
- Formats responses with actionable next steps
- Coordinates between agent components

## Technical Decisions

### Why Playwright?
After extensive testing with both Selenium and Playwright:
- Playwright is significantly faster (50-60% in benchmark tests)
- It handles modern web patterns more reliably
- Automatic waiting for elements eliminated timing issues
- Its API is cleaner and more intuitive

I considered web scraping without browser automation, but you genuinely need browser interaction for Amazon's filters and dynamic navigation.

### Detection Avoidance
Amazon's increasingly sophisticated bot detection required implementing:
- Random delays between actions with natural distribution
- Character-by-character typing with micro-pauses (10-50ms)
- Simple mouse movement simulation
- User agent variety
- Session rotation

### Query Understanding
I was surprised how much value comes from extracting parameters beyond Amazon's UI:
- Exact star ratings like 4.7 (Amazon only does whole stars)
- Country of origin filtering
- Materials specification
- Exclusion criteria

These all require post-filtering since Amazon's interface doesn't support them directly.

### User Personalization (V2)
The personalization system now:
- Stores preferences by user session
- Applies weighted tracking (purchases > additions to cart > views)
- Implements category-specific preferences
- Adjusts scoring based on preference history

## Project Roadmap & Milestones

5. Cross-site integration

Main risks remain:
- Amazon changing their UI (happens constantly)
- Rate limiting/blocking
- Parsing failures on unusual queries
- Bot detection advances

## Resource Planning

### Team Composition
For scaling this up, I'd want:
- 2 Backend devs (Python/Flask)
- 1 ML engineer for query/ranking optimization
- 1 Frontend dev (probably React)
- 1 DevOps (half-time should be enough)
- 1 Product manager

### Infrastructure
Cost projections:
- Dev environment: ~$500-800/month depending on testing volume
- Production: $2-5K/month at scale
- API costs: ~$0.50-1 per complex session (could optimize a lot)
- Proxies/rotation: ~$2K/month at scale

### Technical Debt Considerations
Critical areas to manage:
- Comprehensive refactoring after v2
- Weekly selector maintenance (Amazon changes layouts frequently)
- Monitoring for detection/blocking
- Regular retraining for ranking models

## V2 Agent Architecture

The v2 agent architecture represents a significant advancement:

### Multi-Step Planning
The agent now breaks shopping requests into logical steps:
1. Analyze the query to extract all constraints
2. Determine optimal search strategy
3. Apply Amazon's native filters
4. Add custom post-filtering beyond Amazon's capabilities
5. Research top candidates deeply
6. Compare products meaningfully
7. Personalize ranking based on user preferences

### Reasoning and Decision-Making
- Each step includes explicit reasoning
- The agent maintains multiple interpretations for ambiguous queries
- Uses confidence scoring for recommendations
- Provides justification for product rankings

### Context Maintenance
- Stores user preferences by session ID
- Maintains conversation history with improved follow-up detection
- Tracks category-specific attributes
- Remembers search refinements
